        "# Introduction:\n",
        "In this assignment, we will analyze and solve the classic **digit classification problem** using the well-known **MNIST Dataset**. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of **handwritten digits (digits 0 to 9)** that are written in different forms and variations (varying in handwriting). This makes it an excellent benchmark for understanding and implementing machine learning techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will **compare and contrast three Machine Learning approaches** to solve this digit classification problem. We will explore the way in which these approaches work, try to analyze their strengths and weaknesses and analyze which of the approaches can be more suitable for the following problem.\n",
        "\n",
        " In order to do so, the notebook will be organized into **three key parts** as outlined below:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🔹**Part A: Multi-Class Perceptron** 🤖\n",
        "\n",
        " - In this section of the notebook we will implement the **Perceptron Learning Algorithm** to classify digits. As we will later see, The Perceptron is a **linear binary classifier** and to extend it to multi-class classification problem, we will adopt the **One vs All (OvA)** approach.\n",
        "\n",
        " - This part will involve the use of the **\"Pocket Algorithm\"**, which is an enhancement of the **Perceptron algorithm** for a **linearly inseperable** data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🔹**Part B: Softmax Regression** 🌐\n",
        "\n",
        " - In this section, we will introduce the **Softmax Regression**, a generalization of **Logistic Regression** for multi-class classification.\n",
        " Rather than producing a single positive or negative output, this algorithm provides the **class probabilities**. This characteristic makes it particularly suitable for problems involving more than two classes (multi-class problems) or for cases where we need a more detailed, probabilistic understanding of how likely each class will be.\n",
        "\n",
        " - We use **Cross-Entropy loss** function for optimization. We will explore the strengths of probabilistic models in handling multi-class classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🔹**Part C: Linear Regression** 📊\n",
        "\n",
        " - In this section, we will explore an approach called **Linear Regression** for classification.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Although **Linear Regression** is being usually used in regression tasks (prediction of a certain continuous variable that is also a dependent variable), we will see that this approach can also be adapted for classification problem, by interpreting outputs and applying suitable threshold\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",

        "  - If we were to seek computational efficiency, both **Linear Regression** and **Multi-Class-Perceptron** could be suitable. However, due to the fact that **Linear Regression** is designed for regression tasks, the model can lead to suboptimal classification performance. Therefore the **Multi-class Perceptron** algorithm could be more suitable for separating\n",
